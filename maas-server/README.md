# MaaS - Server Implementation
Implementation of Matomat As A Service using Golang.
Work in progress, feel free to contribute.

The first basic service stub was originally generated using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git), but has moved far from it.

## Biggest TODOs
- Implement persistance layer (interfaces in place, implementation missing)
- Implement Event dispatching to MQTT
- Add missing business logic
